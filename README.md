[TOC](#top)

Hey! I am Luciano! My extensive experience in understanding problems and recommending solutions captivated me by the potential of data science to recommend solutions to improve organizations' products and services. I seek innovative strategies to enhance efficiency, and data science has the resources to discover valuable insights from any business data. I am a permanent resident of Canada, transitioning from academia to the Canadian corporate environment, and my experience and data science education enable me to work efficiently under pressure, prioritize tasks, and respect project deadlines and budgets.

Before transitioning into Data Science, I spent 13 years as a software developer and over 10 years in academia. I did a BSc in Computer Science, an M.Sc., and a  D.Sc. in Science with enfaces in Artificial Intelligence. Throughout my academic years, I acquired a wide range of hard and soft skills that are assets for industry. Some of these skills are as follows:

Credit card fraud occurs when a customer uses a third party's credit card or information to make unauthorized purchases or cash advances. Credit card fraud happens both online and in physical stores. Merchants can avoid problems and bad reputations when they identify fraudulent use of credit cards in their payment environment. Credit card fraud detection is critical for companies to safeguard their customers' purchases and funds by detecting fraud before or as it occurs.

It's not always straightforward to agree on what fraud means. Regardless of how you define fraud, most payments are not fraudulent. Most merchants aren't experts at estimating the business impact of fraud.

Using Machine Learning for credit card fraud detection is an opportunity to create more efficient systems to avoid fraud. These systems will prevent fraud and avoid accusing legitimate purchases of fraud, too. This scenario will give the merchants more credibility, generating higher profits.
